### Customization

3. **Navigation:** Update navigation links in `_layouts/default.html`
4. **Content:** Edit `index.md`, `about.md`, and `blog.md` to match your needs

## Accessibility Guidelines

### Images

Always include descriptive alt text:

```html
<!-- Good -->
<img src="chart.png" alt="Bar chart showing 40% increase in sales">

<!-- Decorative images -->
<img src="decoration.png" alt="" role="presentation">
```

### Headings

Maintain proper heading hierarchy:

- Use only one h1 per page (page title)
- Don't skip heading levels (h1 → h2 → h3, not h1 → h3)
- Use headings for structure, not just styling

### Links

Make links descriptive:

```html
<!-- Good -->
<a href="/report.pdf">Download the 2026 Annual Report (PDF, 2MB)</a>

<!-- Bad -->
<a href="/report.pdf">Click here</a>
```

### Color

Don't rely on color alone to convey information:

```html
<!-- Good -->
<span class="error" aria-label="Error">❌ Invalid email</span>

<!-- Bad -->
<span style="color: red;">Invalid email</span>
```
