## About This Template

This accessible Jekyll template was created to demonstrate best practices for web accessibility in accordance with:

- **WCAG 2.1 Level AA** (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines)
- **Section 508** standards
- **Title II** of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)

### Design Principles

Our template follows these core accessibility principles:

1. **Perceivable:** Information and user interface components must be presentable to users in ways they can perceive
   - All images have alternative text
   - Color is not used as the only visual means of conveying information
   - Text has sufficient contrast against backgrounds (minimum 4.5:1 ratio)

2. **Operable:** User interface components and navigation must be operable
   - All functionality is available via keyboard
   - Users have enough time to read and use content
   - Content does not cause seizures or physical reactions
   - Users can easily navigate and find content

3. **Understandable:** Information and operation of the user interface must be understandable
   - Text is readable and understandable
   - Web pages appear and operate in predictable ways
   - Users are helped to avoid and correct mistakes

4. **Robust:** Content must be robust enough to be interpreted by a wide variety of user agents, including assistive technologies
   - Compatible with current and future user tools
   - Proper HTML5 semantic structure
   - Valid HTML and CSS

### Technical Implementation

This template includes:

- Semantic HTML5 structure
- ARIA landmarks and labels
- Keyboard navigation support
- Skip navigation links
- Proper heading hierarchy
- Focus indicators
- Responsive design
- High contrast mode support
- Reduced motion support
